\title{Study of a population system}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Abstract}
It is our goal to create and run a digital simulation of a population with known, configurable feature, which will later be formally studied on a per-individual and global basis.

\section{Implementation}
This section discusses a Java implementation of the system.\\

We have decided to represent the system not as a whole, but rather as a list of items (preys, predators and resources), each being updated upon a "game tick".

\subsection{Desired features}
Our choice of desirable features is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Natality}
Upon each tick (of duration $\Delta t$), the natality $N_{rate}$ is determined according to this formula:
\[
\frac{\Delta N_{rate}}{\Delta t} = f(t)
\]

TODO: DEFINE FUNCTION, USE CASES (0 IF age$<$something, function else)

\subsection{Natural mortality}
Upon each tick, the mortality $M$ of an individual is determined according to this formula:
\[
\frac{\Delta M}{\Delta t} = g(t)
\]

TODO: SAME

\subsection{Movement}
The direction is determined by a gravity-like algorithm, with some constant $K$ determining the speed. Specifically, the acceleration in a given axis $a$ for the individual $b$ is:
\[
\frac{\partial V_a}{\partial t} = \sum_\text{For\:each\:individual\:i}(\frac{\Delta a}{\sqrt{\text{distance}}}*K*\text{something})
\]

\section{Formal study}
This section provides a simple analysis of the system, based on the study of the algorithms employed.

\subsection{Population}
The population $P$ at the instant $t+1$ is given by:
\[
P(t+1) = N_{rate} * P(t) - M*P(t) = (N_{rate} - M) * P(t)
\]
\[
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} P(t) = (N_{rate} - M)^t\]
with $N_{rate}$ being the natality rate and $M$ the mortality.
Therefore, the transfer function of the population for this system is:
\[
P(t) = (N_{rate} - M)^t
\]
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=(N_{rate} - M)^t \log(N_{rate} - M)
\]
